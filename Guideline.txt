Instructions
1. There are three files in the package: "feature matrix.xls", "interaction matrix.txt" and "SFLLN.py". 
2. "interaction matrix.txt" contains 606 drugs with their known interactions information.
3. "feature matrix.xls" contains four features: chemical substructures, targets£¬enzymes and pathways for 606 drugs.  
4. "SFLLN.py" is the python script, which can run under the enviroment of python 2.7 to implement experiments on our method SFLLN.
The input of "SFLLN.py" includes interaction matrix and interaction matrix, and the output is the 6 metrics(AUPR, AUC, ACC, F1, precision and recall)
in two tasks of prediction, which are saved in "metr_SFLLN.txt" and "metr_semi_SFLLN.txt" respectively.
